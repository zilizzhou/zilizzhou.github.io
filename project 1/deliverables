Writeup

.What was the most challenging piece of this assignment?  
The most challenging piece is I have a lot of thoughts on designing a nice personal 
web but I dont have the ability to do so

.Did you find it easy or challenging to work with HTML and CSS?  
It's not easy, I need a lot of time to play with HTML and CSS, 
especially CSS, in order to present the my design I wanted to. It's hard for 
beginner like me to present my ideas.

.How long did this overall assignment take you?
I would say 8-10hrs

.What decisions did you make when you made your site mobile friendly?
I make navbar to be vertically presented, and adjust the picture sizes to mobile friendly

.What did you take into account when you developed the design of your website?
I take into account if users can obviously know which page they are looking at, 
and if the users can easily get the point on what I am trying to present on the page,
and also if the content I provided on the page is just what the users need. In addition, I 
will try to make the fonts looking consistent, font colors, and background matching, and etc. 

.Is there anything that youâ€™re particularly proud of?
I am proud of the problem solving process I design the web, whenever I found the pages is wired presenting, I do research and try to present a better way to users, even I think my web has a lot of room to improve. 

.Given more time or resources, what additional features would you add to your site in the future? 
I would want to add a menu icon in the navbar when it come to mobile users. In addition, I want
to present pictures as a circle which correspondents to different things, when user move the mouse to the circle, the picture would look relative transparent, but it will show up a short word telling users the picture can lead you to what kind of link. and etc.

.How many hours did you spend on this assignment?
10hrs
